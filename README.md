TiledBitmapView
===============

What Is TiledBitmapView?
------------------------

This Android library provides a [SurfaceView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView.html) implementation whose contents are loaded tilewise from a provider - similar to the way map applications
such as Google Maps load their tiles as the user scrolls around (although this library has absolutely
nothing to do with mapping).
